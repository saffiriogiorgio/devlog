## Hello World

Welcome to my dev log, I am Giorgio Saffirio, a game developer with a strong and solid background as a **Unity Developer**. I love new challenges and the purpose of this dev log is to try with you different ways to develop games.

This blog will not focus only on Unity tutorials or C# but also on **algorithms** and **software design patterns**, **best practices**, **jams**, **web development**, and more. 

Also, if you'd love to write something about one of these topics, please send me a DM on __twitter__ ([@giosaffi](https://www.twitter.com/giosaffi)).

I started this project to hopefully help somebody with coding and myself to get better at it but also to practice writing in English (so please be kind to me!).

Thanks for your time!
