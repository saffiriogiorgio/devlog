## Hello World


Welcome to my dev log, I am Giorgio Saffirio and I am a game developer. I have a strong and solid background as a **Unity Developer** but I love new challenges and trying different ways to develop games. 

This blog will not focus only on Unity tutorials and C# but also on **algorithms** and **software design patterns**, **best practices**, **jams**, **web development**, and more. 

Also, if you'd love to write something about one of these topics, please send me a DM on __twitter__ ([@giosaffi](https://www.twitter.com/giosaffi)).

I started this project to hopefully help somebody with coding and myself to get better at it but also to practice writing English. 

Thanks for your time!
